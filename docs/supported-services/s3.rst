S3 (Simple Storage Service)
===========================
This document contains information about the S3 service supported in Handel. This Handel service provisions an S3 bucket for use by your applications.

.. NOTE::
  
  For static websites in S3, see the :ref:`s3staticsite` service.

Service Limitations
-------------------
This service currently only provisions a bare-bones S3 bucket for data storage. It does support versioning, but the following other features are not currently supported:

* CORS configuration
* Bucket logging
* Cross-region replication

Parameters
----------
This service takes the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

     - No
     - <appName>-<environmentName>-<serviceName>-<serviceType>

.. _s3-lifecycles:

Lifecycles
~~~~~~~~~~
A list of life cycle rules

.. code-block:: yaml

      lifecycles:
        - name: <string> # Required
          prefix: <string> # Optional
          transitions: # Optional but one of transitions or version_transitions are required
            - type: <ia, glacier, expiration> # type must be ia (Standard-IA infrequent Access), glacier, or expiration)
              days: 30
          version_transitions: # Optional but one of transitions or version_transitions are required, only days are supported
            - type: <ia, glacier, expiration>
              days: 30

Transitions are defined by the following:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Required
     - Default
     - Description
   * - type

     - No
     - None
     - Date to transition in ISO 8602 UTC format *must specify all transition as days or dates not both*


More complex example:

.. code-block:: yaml

      lifecycles:
        - name: ia30glacier365expire720
          transitions:
            - type: ia
              days: 30
            - type: expiration
              days: 720
            - type: glacier
              days: 365
          version_transitions:
            - type: ia
              days: 30
            - type: expiration
              days: 90

.. _s3-tags:

Tags
~~~~
The Tags element is defined by the following schema:

.. code-block:: yaml

  tags:
   <your_tag_name>: <your_tag_value>

.. NOTE::

    Handel automatically applies some tags for you. See :ref:`tagging-default-tags` for information about these tags.

Example Handel File
-------------------
This Handel file shows an S3 service being configured:

.. code-block:: yaml

    version: 1

    name: my-s3-bucket

    environments:
      dev:
        mybucket:
          type: s3
          # Because we don't specify a bucket_name, the bucket will be named 'my-s3-bucket-dev-mybucket-s3' (see default in table above)
          versioning: enabled

-------------------------
This service outputs the following environment variables:
