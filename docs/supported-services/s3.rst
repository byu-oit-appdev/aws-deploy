* Bucket-level ACLs.
* CORS configuration

* Bucket logging
* Cross-region replication
* Static websites

----------
This service takes the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

     - Default
     - Description
   * - bucket_name
     - string
     - Yes
     - 
     - The name of the bucket to create. This name must be globally unique across all AWS accounts, so 'myBucket' will likely be taken. :)
