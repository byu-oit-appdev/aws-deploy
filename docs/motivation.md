# Motivation
TODO - Explain why this over manual creation, CloudFormation, Terraform, Apache Brooklyn, etc.
Valuable reasons this approach is nice
    -Automated creation keeps free from manual mistakes
    -Free inter-dependency security (security groups, IAM roles)
    -Free application wiring (service location)
    -Opinionated way of doing things (tagging, etc.)
    -Quick configuration for services, faster than writing CloudFormation
