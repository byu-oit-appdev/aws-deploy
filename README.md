# Handel
Orchestrates your AWS deployments so you don't have to.

# Description
Handel is a library that provides easy deployments for applications in AWS. It reads a declarative specification file and provisions and deploys
resources, automatically wiring up the painful security bits between resources.

# Usage
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/byu-oit-appdev/handel/wiki) for documentation on this library.

# Credits
The concepts in this library were originally introduced by the platform engineers at [FamilySearch](https://familysearch.org/). I've adapted their concept of Blueprints for use in this library.
